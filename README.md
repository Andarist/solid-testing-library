## The Problem

You want to write tests for your Solid components so that they avoid including implementation
details, and are maintainable in the long run.

## The Solution

The Solid Testing Library is a very lightweight solution for testing Solid components. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

## Installation

This module is distributed via npm which is bundled with node and should be installed
as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @solidjs/testing-library
```

If you using Jest we recommend using [solid-jest](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-jest) to properly resolve the browser version of Solid as Jest will default to the server version when run in Node.

üí° If you are using Jest or vitest, you may also be interested in installing `@testing-library/jest-dom` so you can use
[the custom jest matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom).

## Integration with Vite

A working Vite template setup with `solid-testing-library` and TypeScript support can be found [here](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/with-vitest).

## Docs

See the [docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/preact-testing-library/intro) over at the Testing Library website.

There are several key differences, though:

‚ö†Ô∏è The `render` function takes in a function that returns a Solid Component, rather than simply the component itself.

```tsx
// With @testing-library/preact
const results = render(<YourComponent />, options);
```

```tsx
// With solid-testing-library
const results = render(() => <YourComponent />, options);
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Solid.js does *not* rerender, it merely executes side effects triggered by reactive state that change the DOM, therefore there is no rerender method. You can use global signals to manipulate your test component in a way that causes it to update.

Solid.js' reactive changes are pretty instantaneous, so there is rarely need to use `waitFor(‚Ä¶)` or `await findByRole(‚Ä¶)` - with the exception of transitions and Suspense.

‚ö†Ô∏è Solid.js external reactive state does not require any DOM elements to run in, so our `renderHook` call has no `container`, `baseElement` or queries in its options or return value. Instead, it has an `owner` to be used with [`runWithOwner`](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#runwithowner) if required. It also exposes a `cleanup` function, though this is already automatically called after the test is finished.

## Issues

If you find any issues, please [check on the issues page](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library/issues) if they are already known. If not, opening an issue will be much appreciated, even more so if it contains a

- short description
- minimal reproduction code
- list of possible workarounds, if there are any

If you think you can fix an issue yourself, feel free to [open a pull-request](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library/pulls). If functionality changes, please don't forget to add or adapt tests.
